Abstract: The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is one of the most precious inventions of Internet of things (IOT). UAV faces the necessity to
charge battery or replace battery from the charging stations during or between services. We propose scheduling algorithms for drone
power charging (SADPC). The basic idea of algorithm is considering both a deadline (for increasing deadline miss ratio) and a charging
time (for decreasing waiting time) to decide priority on charging station among drones. Our simulation results show that our power charging
algorithm for drones are efficient in terms of the deadline miss ratio as well as the waiting time in general in compare to other conventional
algorithms (EDF or SJF). Also, we can choose proper algorithms for battery charge scheduling and charge ready battery allocation according
to system parameters and user requirements based on our simulation.
